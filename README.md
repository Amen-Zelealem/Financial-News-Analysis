# Financial Analysis Report 

## Overview

The **Financial Analysis** Project aims to analyze a large corpus of financial news data to uncover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. This initiative is designed to refine skills in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE). The project not only deepens the understanding of essential financial analytic techniques but also simulates the pressures and deadlines typical in the financial analytics field.
## Business Objective

Nova Financial Solutions seeks to enhance its predictive analytics capabilities to significantly boost its financial forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency through advanced data analysis. As a Data Analyst, the primary focus is on:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Quantifying the tone and sentiment in financial news headlines using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Establishing statistical correlations between news sentiment and stock price movements, tracking changes around the publication date of articles.

## Dataset Overview

The **Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID)** combines quantitative and qualitative data to improve stock market predictions. Key fields include:

- **headline**: The title of the news article.
- **url**: Direct link to the full article.
- **publisher**: Author or creator of the article.
- **date**: Publication date and time (UTC-4 timezone).
- **stock**: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).

## Progress & Completed Tasks

### Completed Tasks

1. **Publisher Analysis**
   - Analyzed the frequency and type of news contributed by various publishers.

2. **Text Analysis**
   - Conducted sentiment analysis on headlines to gauge sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
   - Utilized NLP to extract common keywords and topics.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Generated basic statistics for textual lengths (e.g., headline length).
   - Counted the number of articles per publisher to identify the most active publishers.
   - Analyzed publication dates to uncover trends over time.

4. **Quantitative Analysis**
   - Employed libraries such as **pynance** and **TaLib** for quantitative analysis.

5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Established links between sentiment scores and stock price movements, providing a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics.

6. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Investigated publication frequency over time and its correlation with market events.

## Conclusion

All tasks outlined in the project have been successfully completed. This project serves as a rigorous exercise in financial analytics, equipping participants with essential skills and insights to navigate the complex interplay between news sentiment and stock market dynamics. The comprehensive analysis will inform future predictive modeling and investment strategies.
